# data-newsletters

News letters are growing in popularity by the day and the curation helps to really tune into the signal as there is quite a lot of noise around data these past years.
This repository consists of all the newsletters, that have been vetted across the data domain that one could subscribe to. The reason this is a repository and not a blog post is because, it has a tendency to grow and change in time.
